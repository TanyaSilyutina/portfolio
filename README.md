# Projects Portfolio

## Description

Using HTML and CSS, I created a portfolio page that showcases my current coding projects.
The purpose of the portfolio page is to present my work to my future employers.
While building this webpage, I learned a lot about how to style pages with CSS FlexBox.
The most challenging part was setting up media queries for different screen sizes.
